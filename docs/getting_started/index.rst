Getting Started
***************

To use a StackHut service (either your own private service, or a public service) from your code, you simply need to make an HTTP POST request - as described in :ref:`tutorial_use`.

To create your own service, sign-up for an account and install the StackHut CLI, as described in :ref:`installation`. You can then follow the walk-through in :ref:`tutorial_create`.
