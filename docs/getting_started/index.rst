Getting Started

StackHut is comprised of 2 major parts - the hosting platform full of live APIs that you can call from your code, and the development platform with which to create your own live APIs.

To use a StackHut service from within your own code you just need to make a JSON-RPC HTTP request - as described in :ref:`tutorial_use`.

To create your own StackHut service from your own code and rapidly hot it within the cloud, just follow the instructions in :ref:`installation` to get the development tools, and then go through the walk-through in :ref:`tutorial_create`
