Getting Started

StackHut is comprised of 2 major parts - the hosting platform full of live APIs that you can call from your code, and the development platform with which to create and deploy your own APIs.

To use a StackHut service from within your own code you just need to make a JSON-RPC HTTP request - as described in :ref:`tutorial_use`.

To create your own StackHut service from your own code and rapidly deploy it online - grab the development tools as described in :ref:`installation` and go through the walk-through in :ref:`tutorial_create`.
