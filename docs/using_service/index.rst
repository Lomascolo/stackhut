Using Service
*************

In this section we describe how to make use of services within your own code, be it client-side JS, mobile apps, internal systems or server code itself. This can be done using either a client-side library for your chosen language, or by using the underlying JSON+HTTP protocol directly - either way we endeavour to make communicating with your services as easy as possible.
