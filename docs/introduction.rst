StackHut is a way to deploy and run code in the cloud without worrying about a traditional server. 

You write a normal class in Python or JavaScript, specify your stack (operating system, language, and any dependencies), and specify the interface into your code. When you deploy it, it is provisioned and replicated on a Kubernetes cluster and can be called directly through an HTTP POST request, or through JSON-RPC, from anywhere (even client-side JavaScript.)

This means you can run functions and fully-fledged applications without deploying code to a traditional server. You can focus on the business logic, instead of spending time with server/API logic.
