StackHut is a way to deploy and run code in the cloud, which can then be called through a POST request. 

This means you can run functions, or fully-fledged applications,without deploying that code to a traditional server and worrying about implementing infrastructure or an API.

Through this model, StackHut offers a repository of public, open-source, services which you can run: you can think of it as a repository of live code in the way GitHub is a repository of source-code. Anyone can contribute these services.
